I am the open-source contributor for the Google Summer of Code 2024 working on the AI Programmer project for Rocket.Chat. In this repository I will clarify a final report summary of my GSoC work and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

The AI Programmer Rocket.Chat App enables users to generate a short piece of code in C/C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript or Python based on their specification. They can switch between different LLMs (Mistral, CodeLlama, etc.) and ask for a new refinement on the code generation result to make augment or fine-tune. A well-designed interactive UX aiming to simplify user's interactions is also implemented. Finally, the app bridges the generated codes with sharing APIs, allowing users to share the code pieces in RC channel or their Github repositories. 


## üö¢ Deliverables

The following were the deliverables of this project:

- Interactive User Interface : Unlock the true potential of the UiKit and add an interactive user interface for each of the added features of the application, eliminating the need to type long slash commands for more complex tasks.
- Minimal Slash Command Interface : Adding slash command to trigger the application to manipulate on the AI programmer's functions with minimal interactions.
- User Configuration: Users can specify their personalized configuration for code generation tasks, for example, use which programming language and LLM.
- Code Generation: Allowing users to generate code pieces by providing their requirements and specifications.
- Code Refinement: Users can further ask for a new variation of the code or augment/fine-tune the system for a more precise result.
- Share Code to Github Repository: By configuring the OAuth2 connection with Github, users can upload their generated code pieces to the target Github repository, branch, file.

Extra Features which were suggested by mentors throughout the Google Summer of Code period:

- Share Code in RC Channel: The generated code is not only viewable by the users, but can also be shared into current RC channels for other users to check.
- Compatible with New Version UI-Kit: Since the RC server and app engine's ui-kit update frequently, the entire user interface is well-designed and implemented with new version features and compatible with RC servers.   

**It's glad to complete all of the above deliverables and meet expected goals within the GSoC period! üéâ**

## üì∫ Demo

### Minimal Slash Command Interface

The Minimal Slash commands allow users to handle ai programmer functions using simple slash commands. Users can generate code, set personalized configuration, connect to Github, and share codes. These commands allow users to access the app's features more conveniently. 

1. Generate code pieces with specific description (please set language and llm correctly first!) -> \`/ai-programmer gen code_content\`
2. Set the language you want to use to generate code -> \`/ai-programmer set C++\`
3. Switch to the LLM you want to use to generate code -> \`/ai-programmer llm llama3-70b\`
4. List the available LLM options -> \`/ai-programmer list \`
5. Use the interactive user interface to handle your operations -> \`/ai-programmer ui \`
6. Login to Github (You should set OAuth2 settings first!) -> \`/ai-programmer login \`.
7. Logout to Github -> \`/ai-programmer logout \`.

### User Interface

For users who prefers UX interactions, the app also provides access by UX. The user interface will be invoked directly using command \`/ai-programmer\`, which will open a contexutal bar for users to set their configurations. After the configurations are set and ready, users can progress to other functions.

The friendly user interface implemented using RC app engine's ui-kit allows interactive operations on all features and functions provided by the ai programmer. All manipulation opereations can be seen in the video:

### üîê GitHub OAuth

In the GitHub App I have implemented the Authentication mechanism using OAuth2. Here we have used the [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) along with the [RocketChat Apps Oauth2 Client](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/adding-features/oauth2-client).     
- The users can log in to their github accounts simply by entering the slash command : `/github login` and clicking on the `login` button.
- As soon as the user is logged in, they receive a message and they can now use all the features which require authorized users.
- The users are automatically logged out after a period of time and the token is deleted. This was done to ensure the scalability of the feature in case of inactive users and to remove old OAuth tokens from the apps limited persistent storage. To achieve this we use the [RocketChat Apps Scheduler API](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/adding-features/scheduler-api).

## Pushing Limits

- In order to make this project a success we have pushed Rocket.Chat to the limit. To improve the collaboration and bring the GitHub conversations to Rocket.Chat we decided to add a Code Editor component to Rocket.Chat. This task was not so easy and required a lot of research.  
- Adding any new Component to the UIKit and making it re-usable for other Rocket.Chat App developers requires us to go through a series of additions in different repositories and understanding how [fuselage](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/tree/develop/packages/fuselage), [ui-kit](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/tree/develop/packages/ui-kit), [fuselage-ui-kit](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/tree/develop/packages/fuselage-ui-kit) and [Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine) work together to render components inside [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat). 
- The detailed documentation on how we went about adding a Code Editor to Rocket.Chat can be seen over here : [Pull Request Reviews : Integrating Code Editor with Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Github22/wiki/Pull-Request-Reviews--:-Integrating-Code-Editor-with-Syntax-Highlighting).
- To use the GitHub App the full potential, feel free to use the version of the GitHub App which uses the upgraded version of Rocket.Chat and other packages with the CodeEditor Component, update the dependencies to use modified versions of the Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine, fuselgae, ui-kit and fuselage-ui-kit.
   - [GitHub App with CodeEditor Component](https://github.com/samad-yar-khan/Apps.Github22/tree/demoApp).
   - [fuselage, ui-kit and fuselage-ui-kit with Code Editor integration](https://github.com/samad-yar-khan/fuselage/tree/CodeEditorInputAce).
   - [Rocket.Chat with intigrated Code Editor in the fuselage-ui-kit package](https://github.com/samad-yar-khan/Rocket.Chat/tree/CodeEditorComponent).
 
- GitHub App with the integrated CodeEditor can be used on this [hosted server](https://gh-app.rocketchat.digital/). This server uses the above-mentioned, upgraded versions of fuselage, ui-kit, Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine and Rocket.Chat.

## Documentation 

I have documented all of the features mentioned above in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Github22/wiki). This documentation can prove useful to all future Rocket.Chat contributors working on Rocket.Chat Apps, Apps-engine, fuselage or the ui-kit.
